# Data Structures and Algorithm implementations
This repo includes various JS data structure and algorithm implementations.

Following along with this course: https://www.udemy.com/course/js-algorithms-and-data-structures-masterclass.

## Data Structures
- Linked list
- Doubly linked list
- Queue
- Stack
- Binary search tree
- Hash table
- Max binary heap
- Max priority queue
- Min priority queue
- Graph
- Weighted graph

## Algorithms
### Sorting
- Bubble sort
- Insertion sort
- Merge sort
- Quick sort
- Selection sort
### Searching
- Binary search
### Random
- Roman numeral to integer

## Running
Each of the implementations are standalone modules. I'd recommend running them directly with Node:
```
node src/sorting/bubble-sort.js
```
